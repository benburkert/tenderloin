module Tenderloin
  module Actions
    # Base class for any class which will act as a runner
    # for actions. A runner handles queueing up and executing actions,
    # and executing the methods of an action in the proper order. The
    # action runner also handles invoking callbacks that actions may
    # request.
    #
    # # Executing Actions
    #
    # Actions can be executed by adding them and executing them all
    # at once:
    #
    #     runner = Tenderloin::Actions::Runner.new
    #     runner.add_action(FooAction)
    #     runner.add_action(BarAction)
    #     runner.add_action(BazAction)
    #     runner.execute!
    #
    # Single actions have a shorthand to be executed:
    #
    #     Tenderloin::Actions::Runner.execute!(FooAction)
    #
    # Arguments may be passed into added actions by adding them after
    # the action class:
    #
    #     runner.add_action(FooAction, "many", "arguments", "may", "follow")
    #
    class Runner
      include Tenderloin::Util

      class << self
        # Executes a specific action, optionally passing in any arguments to that
        # action. This method is shorthand to initializing a runner, adding a single
        # action, and executing it.
        def execute!(action_klass, *args)
          runner = new
          runner.add_action(action_klass, *args)
          runner.execute!
