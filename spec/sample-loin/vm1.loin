Tenderloin::Config.run do |config|
  # All Tenderloin configuration is done here. For a detailed explanation
  # and listing of configuration options, please check the documentation
  # online.

  # Every Tenderloin virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
  config.vm.box = "base"
  # You can optionally specify a path or URL to automatically retrieve it from
  # config.vm.box_url = "http://download"

  ## SSH username and password defaults to 'tenderloin'. You can change this.
  ## If you provide a key, this will be used over the password
  # config.ssh.username = 'youruser'
  # config.ssh.password = 'yourpass'
  # config.ssh.key = '~/.ssh/id_rsa'
  ## SSH key can also be an array of keys
  # config.ssh.keys = ['~/.ssh/id_rsa', '~/.ssh/id_rsa_other']

  ## Provisioning can either provide a shell script, or a command to execute.
  ## You can also provide folders to rsync (over SSH)
  # config.provisioning.script = <<EOF
# ls /usr
# EOF
  # config.provisioning.command = "apt-get install -y ruby"
  ## This is destructive - it uses the --delete flag
  # config.provisioning.rsync << ["src/", "dst"]

  ## Shared folders are enabled by default, and the project dir is always shared
  ## You can turn this off, or add additional folders
  # config.shared_folders.enabled = false
  # config.shared_folders.folders << ["my-files", "src", "/mnt/src"]
  # config.shared_folders.folders << ["bin-files", "bin", "/mnt/bin"]
end
